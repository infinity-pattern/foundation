# Foundation 

- Support of projects within the infinity-pattern organization. 
Feature list:
- Support for CLI applications
	- Program Version Support
	- A consistent Error structure.
- Provide the Boost libraries for consumers.
	This is because many of the components of the boost library are better written and higher quality 
	that what I can provide. And to reimplement them is not something I am interested in.
	However, the components themselves are integral to providing a consistent look and feel to the 
	programs across the organization, which is something I am interested in. and as such the only
	portions that the foundation library itself will provide are those components which have no 
	better option within Boost, or are to organization specific to be found within Boost.
